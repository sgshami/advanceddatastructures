# advanceddatastructures
These are the projects assigned in my COMP 282 class Advanced Data Structures.
Each assignment focused on a certain way to sort and store data. 
All programs are written in Java.

ShamiH1: Implementing Quicksort and Mergesort Algorithms

ShamiH2: Using external sort (read from a file). Use normal sort for sorting and 2-way-merge 
to merge back to 1 file

ShamiH3: Using external sort. Use Replacement Selection Sort and n-way-merge

ShamiH4: Implementing a BTree. 

ShamiH5: Matrix chain multiplication Recursive and Dynamic Programming

ShamiH6: Using a Binary Search tree to insert words and print them.

Tester: Random implementation of matrix multiplication

shamisort: Goals: reading input from anyinputfile; anyinputfile should be created using any IDE; an input file using any IDE;
Stores input numbers in arr[]; Prints arr[] formatted k numbers per line;
before and after bubble sort; Compile and execute at the command prompt

input files are files used to test the above programs.
